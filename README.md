## A social media app with React and Express

This is my solution to the last project of the OpenClassroom's web developer course. This challenge is  about creating a small social media app.

### The challenge

You will need to use Express JS for the back end and React for the front. Your users should be able to:

- Login
- Signup
- See all posts on the homepage
- Create a new post 
- Update a post 
- Like a post 


### Built with

- HTML5/CSS/SASS
- React JS
- Express JS
